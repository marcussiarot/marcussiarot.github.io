<section id="about">
<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
    I am passionate about exploring the intersection of electrical engineering and biomedical technology. 
    I’m excited to deepen my knowledge in this field and aspire to build a career where I can contribute to innovative healthcare solutions.
    I graduated from University Laboratory School (high school) in 2022.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was born and raised on Oahu for my entire life.
    On my free time I enjoy spending time with my family and friends and being outdoors or indoors.
    Some of my hobbies include bowling, exercising, chess (I'm not very good), and trying out new places to eat (if that counts as a hobby).
    In general, I like trying out new things and I hope to continue to expand my horizons.

<h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I got my first job at Tanioka's Seafood and Catering the summer after I graduated high school.
    I primarily worked in the front customer service area where I served food while gaining key interpersonal skills.  
    My favorite part of the job was being a delivery driver/event caterer.
    I was able to attend various celebrations around the island like parties and weddings and see a lot of new things.
    However, after a little over two years, I decided to move on and focus on school as it was my main priority.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also worked as an assistant swimming coach back at the same team I swam with in high school.
    My main task was organizing and assigning events to swimmers and maintaining good communication with the swimmers and parents.
  </p>
  <p>
    As of Summer 2025, I am working as an Electrical Engineering Intern at Bowers + Kubota Consulting and I look forward to gaining a lot of experience.
